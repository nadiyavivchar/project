CS50x Harvard Final project 2019

The project was created especially for CS50x and Harvard University. 

The primary idea of the website is to share some basic information about Ukraine and share a short test on the basic knowledge about the country. 

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website. 

As for the moment, the idea of the website is quite simple - to share the info. 

A new goal for 2020 is to add login option, post functions, video and photo gallery as well.
